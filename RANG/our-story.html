    <!-- The Origin -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Origin</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>Rang.in was born with a single vision — to preserve the timeless heritage of Madhubani art and connect it with the modern world. Bihar is not just a place, it is a treasure trove of centuries-old art forms that tell stories of mythology, nature, and culture.</p>
        <p>But in today's digital age, our local artists were being left behind. We saw how machine-made fake paintings were being sold in the market as originals. That's why we created Bihari Store — a platform that bridges tradition with technology, ensuring every artwork is authentic and every artist is empowered.</p>

    <!-- The Mission -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Mission</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>Our mission is to empower local artists, ensure fair recognition, and create a trusted marketplace where every artwork tells a story of culture, tradition, and identity. Each piece is curated, verified, and celebrated.</p>
        <p>We believe in preserving Bihar's artistic legacy while giving artists the tools and platform they need to reach a global audience.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- The Vision -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Vision</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>We envision a future where every Madhubani artist has a global audience, sustainable income, and pride in their heritage. Rang.in is not just a marketplace — it is a cultural movement.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to expand beyond Madhubani and showcase all of Bihar's rich artistic traditions — from Tikuli art to bamboo crafts, from terracotta to traditional textiles.</p>
